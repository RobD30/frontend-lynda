#Notes from UX Design

Search Bar
* standard for top right of content
* make sure its long enough for the user to type in what they want to search for.

Work out what your site is about and express that concisely on your page
* usually beneath the title of the page
* also useful to put in the title bar (limit to 64 characters or less.)

Use a breadcrumb trail.
* use fun designs for it

Arranging content
* Scrolling (totally the best)
* Sequential
* Split

# Notes from UX Accessibility

Actually refers to how a person with a disability interacts with your site.
* Buttons are great for accessibility
* Radio buttons should come before search buttons
* The search button can be considered the end of the page by some.
* If things are closely related they should be grouped together.
*
