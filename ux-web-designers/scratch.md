#Notes from UX Design

Search Bar
* standard for top right of content
* make sure its long enough for the user to type in what they want to search for.

Work out what your site is about and express that concisely on your page
* usually beneath the title of the page
* also useful to put in the title bar (limit to 64 characters or less.)

Use a breadcrumb trail.
* use fun designs for it

Arranging content
* Scrolling (totally the best)
* Sequential
* Split
